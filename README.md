## Overview
This project is a web design assignment showcasing various HTML, CSS, and Sass techniques. It focuses on creating responsive, accessible, and visually appealing web pages using advanced styling methods provided by Sass.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Responsive Layout (Flexbox)**
- **Where**: Applied in the main section of the homepage.
- **How**: The layout uses the Flexbox model to ensure responsive behavior across different screen sizes. The `.flex-container` class was styled using the `@include flexbox` mixin, which defines `display: flex` and `justify-content: space-between` for easy alignment of elements.

### 2. **Hover Effects**
- **Where**: On buttons and feature blocks (like "Join Our Program", "Call Us Now").
- **How**: Hover effects were added using Sass with the `&:hover` feature to change the background color when hovering over `.flex-item` elements. This gives users visual feedback when interacting with these elements.

### 3. **Sass Variables and Color Scheme**
- **Where**: Throughout the entire stylesheet.
- **How**: Sass variables were used to manage a consistent color scheme. For instance, `$primary-color` and `$secondary-color` were defined at the beginning of the Sass file and reused across various components, ensuring consistency and making it easy to update the theme.

- **Benefits**: This allows for easy global color changes without having to update multiple CSS rules.

### 4. **Mixin for Flexbox**
- **Where**: Used in multiple sections of the website.
- **How**: A custom `@mixin flexbox` was created for applying flexbox properties consistently throughout the project. By using the mixin, I reduced the amount of repetitive CSS code when handling layout elements.

- **Benefits**: The mixin improves maintainability and reusability across different components.

### 5. **Nesting of CSS Selectors**
- **Where**: Used for elements within forms and buttons.
- **How**: Nesting of CSS selectors was implemented in the `.login-form` and other elements for better organization and readability. For example, the input fields and buttons are nested within the form class:

- **Benefits**: This reduces clutter in the stylesheet and makes it easier to maintain the hierarchy of styles.

### 6. **Partials for Code Organization**
- **Where**: The Sass codebase.
- **How**: I divided the Sass files into partials (e.g., `_mixins.sass`, `_variables.sass`, etc.) and imported them into the main stylesheet using `@import`. This modular approach improves code organization and maintainability.
 

### 7. **Button Styles with @extend**
- **Where**: Applied to buttons across different pages.
- **How**: Button styling was standardized using `@extend` to apply common button properties like padding, background color, and text alignment. This ensures that all buttons follow the same design language.


### 8. **Color Manipulation (Lighten/Darken)**
- **Where**: For hover effects and background colors.
- **How**: The `lighten()` and `darken()` functions were used to manipulate colors dynamically. For example, on hover, the background of `.flex-item` elements is lightened:
 
### 9.   **added Interpolation**
- **Where**: for providing styling to gridcontainer2


### 10. **Sass Placeholder Selectors (%centered)**
- **Where**: For button and form styling.
- **How**: Placeholder selectors (e.g., `%centered`) were used for common styles such as centering content, which was then extended to buttons and other elements. This reduces redundancy and improves code efficiency.
